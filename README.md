# TimeModal

I created a single web page for a mock-up company. I used HTML and CSS to style it using modern design trends and page layout. The site is  also responsive.Further, I used JavaScript to create a modal to appear after a given amount of time on the page. Is it a prompt to get the user to enter their email address to sign up for the company newsletter.
